                <div class="typogriditem">
                    <h1>Axial</h1>
                    <p>In axial typography all of the content is divided by a line and aligned on either side of this
                        line.</p>
                    <p>I achieved this with the line running horizontally through the canvas and adding The title on one
                        side and the main information on the other.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="typogriditem">

                    <h1>Bilateral</h1>
                    <p>Bilateral typography is similar to axial as they both divide the content by a line. However, the
                        bilateral system
                        centres the text on this line.
                    </p>

                    <p>I made sure all text was perfectly aligned along the centre of the canvas to achieve this.</p>

                <div class="typogriditem">
                    <h1>Dilatational</h1>
                    <p>Dilatational typography places the text around the edge of a circle.</p>
                    <p>This typography type took a while as I wanted all the text to be readable and clear. I flipped
                        some of the text to create
                        a clean look.

                <div class="typogriditem">
                    <h1>Grid</h1>
                    <p>Grid typography is the oldest typography type, it neatly fits the content into columns and rows.
                    </p>
                    <p>I created this by dividing the content up into individual columns, I aligned all the text to the
                        left to keep
                        consistency.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Radial</h1>
                    <p>In radial typography text emits out from a point like rays from a sun.</p>
                    <p>In this design I split up the text and arranged it around the circle on the top left.</p>

                <div class="typogriditem">
                    <h1>Random</h1>
                    <p>Random typography designs follow no pattern whatsoever, they are completely random.</p>
                    <p>I split up the text into small phrases and words, changing the size, angle and pretty much
                        everything else.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Transitional designs place text along natural lines such as sediment or flowing water.</p>
                    <p>I created random lines and placed the text along these lines. This design took me a while as
                        I had to split up individual words and angle everything according to the lines.

                    </p>
                    <p>I opted to use different sized circles for this design with the various text placed in each.</p>

                <h1>Design 1</h1>
                <p>This is my first design. After looking through all of the images provided this one stood out
                    to me and i thought it would look great as a background. I cut out the individual balloons at the
                    top and placed them over the logo, creating depth. I wanted to keep a consistent colour scheme to
                    keep
                    the design tidy which I achieved with the white text and white sponsor logos at the bottom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is
                    contrast in the capitalized black text on the left side of the page. this also effectively draws the
                    viewers eyes back to the
                    top of the page when they reach the bottom. I really liked the large amount of blank space on this
                    design.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="carpgriditem">

                <h1>Design 2</h1>
                <p>This is my second design. I kept many aspects of the first poster the same but opted for a coloured
                    background. I used
                    dark blue as it matched the theme and included a large image of a balloon aligned centrally with all
                    of the content.

                <p>I
                    added a very light white triangle which contrasted the dark background. It was also off-centre which
                    created more contrast.
                    I definitely preferred that the key information was in proximity to one another as opposed to the
                    first design.

            <div class="carpgriditem">

                <h1>Design 3</h1>
                <p>For my third design I wanted to try something new. I found a good image online of the balloons flying
                    over the
                    suspension bridge and placed this at the top of the page. I cut up the logo and created a column at
                    an angle which
                    I thought worked well. I placed the logos underneath and created contrast with 
                    the key information running across the page at a different angle. I wasn't a fan of how this design
                    worked out and thought it was messy and poorly aligned.

                <h1>Final Design</h1>

                <p>this is my final design. I decided to use the first one i created as I really liked the professional
                    look of
                    it. After receiving feeback
                    about areas I could improve I changed a number of things. Firstly, I had not put anything behind the
                    text on the left
                    hand side of the page, meaning it was transparent, I changed this to white.

                <p>The logo looked
                    cluttered with the balloons
                    covering the text so I took these out in photoshop and placed them elsewhere, giving the poster a
                    cleaner look. I made the sponsor logos
                    smaller to give emphasis to the main content.
                <p></p>Lastly, I moved the text from the bottom and aligned
                it with the dates. I made these both a lot bigger and aligned them each around a circle creating a
                banner
                effect. This worked well
                as it also created repetition with the shapes of the balloons.

                <p>These worksheets gave me the tools to create basic web pages using HTML. I was introduced to github 
                    which has been extremely helpful in organising all of my related files and saving progress. Worksheet 3 
                    introduced me to basic CSS which allowed me to style elements on the two web pages and flexbox which is incredibly
                    important in CSS. Also many other vital aspects such as selectors and adding fonts. I found these tasks relatively
                    straightforward.

                <p>These worksheets focused mainly on learning and applying flexbox in greater detail. I learnt how to add different
                    media content and position these on different areas of the page using flexbox which have been vital in creating my
                final website. I ultimately did have to learn about CSS grids which were not covered within the worksheets.</p>

                <h1>Wireframe layout + UX </h1>
                <p>My aim was to create a simplistic yet professional looking website incorporating all of the skills I
                    had
                    learnt this semester through the various HTML worksheets. I wanted it to be as easy as possible to
                    use for anyone
                    who may be looking at it.
                </p>

                <p>I opted for a bright pastel colourscheme for my website as many of the examples I had seen
                    were very dark and dull, I found a bold font on google fonts which really contrasted
                    the light colourscheme well. Originally I had the text coloured the same colour as the background of 
                    each section placed on white. This was hard to view with the light colours so I opted for all black text. 
                    I kept all aspects extremely consistent which added to the professional
                    look.
                </p>

                <p>I stuck to the layout I had designed pretty much exactly, apart from the HTML page. i found
                    it was quite cramped having two wide web pages with the text on one row so opted to drop the text
                    underneath.

            <section class="Reflection">
                <p>I really enjoyed completing this module and creating my website. I have leart how to use multiple new softwares such 
                    as Adobe InDesign and illustrator both of which i'm looking forward to learn in greater depth in future modules. graphic design
                    was one of the topics i was really excited about and it was very interesting learning about the typography types and CARP principles 
                    and applying these to create digital works. 
                </p>
                <p>I had learnt a great deal from the various html worksheets which helped massively in creating various aspects of my website. However, 
                    i did struggle with styling the website at first. It was incredibly difficult to get the layout i wanted without using the grid
                    layout, which wasn't taught in the module. I experimented with various commands such as floating but was unsuccesful. After I had researched the grid 
                    layout I was able to apply it to my website and style it the way I originally wanted it.
